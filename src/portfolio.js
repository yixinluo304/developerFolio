Using Hugging Face‚Äôs DistilBERT model and multithreading for scalability, I classified sentiment by aspect to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses in guest experiences. In parallel, I performed frequency-based linguistic analysis to identify recurring unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, which were then visualized to highlight common themes and priorities. This dual approach helps businesses better understand guest concerns, enhance service quality, and uncover patterns that drive customer satisfaction.",

Using Python, Snowflake SQL, and Amazon EC2/S3, we built and tested models including logistic regression, random forest, and MLP on a highly imbalanced dataset. We introduced realistic feature perturbations‚Äîsuch as changes in transaction amount, time, and distance from home‚Äîto simulate evasion tactics. Our results showed that while random forest performed best under normal conditions, MLP demonstrated the greatest resilience under adversarial manipulation, highlighting its potential for secure real-world deployment. All workflows were fully version-controlled and cloud-integrated to support scalable, reproducible fraud analytics.",
